Feature engineering 
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. If feature engineering is done correctly, it increases the predictive power of machine learning algorithms by creating features from raw data that help facilitate the machine learning process. Feature Engineering is an art.
"Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data"
Ex:Feature engineering is the most important art in machine learning which creates the huge difference between a good model and a bad model. Let’s see what feature engineering covers.
Suppose, we are given a data “flight date time vs status”. Then, given the date-time data, we have to predict the status of the flight.
As the status of the flight depends on the hour of the day, not on the date-time. We will create the new feature “Hour_Of_Day”. Using the “Hour_Of_Day” feature, the machine will learn better as this feature is directly related to the status of the flight.
Here, creating the new feature “Hour_Of_Day” is the feature engineering.
